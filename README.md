# Userscripts
This is a collection of userscripts that I use in Tampermonkey

## invino-cellartracker.user.js
This script inserts a small cellartracker.com search link into product pages on invino.com.
It has been tested only in Tampermonkey using Chrome Browser. YMMV in other browsers. 
You can install it from greasyfork.org at: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/15862-invino-cellartracker-integration
